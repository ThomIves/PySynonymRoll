# PySynonymRoll
Python Based Synonym Harvester

![Py Synonym Roll Logo](https://github.com/ThomIves/PySynonymRoll/blob/master/Py_Synonym_Roll_Logo.png)
> A progressive guide on how to develop a synonym harvester using python.

## Getting started

1. This code accompanies the blog post [Python Based Synonym Harvester](https://integratedmlai.com/python-based-synonym-harvester/), and it is best to walk through this code from there.
2. Specific_Syns_1.py is some VERY simple code that shows the basics on how to capture the html code for a specific word page from Thesaurus.com.
3. Specific_Syns_2.py shows how the core data was captured from each word page.
4. Syns_Module_Builder.py holds the creation of a class structure for what was developed in Specific_Syns_2.py.
5. The remaining files are storage of collected and/or reformatted data.
